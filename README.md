Graduate Research and Thesis around Security Forecasting

Summary:
Hi Everyone! I'm working on completing my masters and to do that I'm soliciting my security friends to help with their participation. My thesis is around analyzing data on the variance of how we all forecast security events and the confidence we have in our forecast. I'll be asking friends that work in both infosec and technology to participate. 

If you've never participated in forecasting before, this is a great video to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TNCYVrm8aM

As far as the ask and the methodology.
Once a week I will release 1 new question to forecast to 100+ friends. 

## Questions

### Question for Monday, June 8th

The goal of these questions was to determine if there was any variance between security participants as well as variance compared to technical participants. In many cases I'm trying to analyze if there is variance also between security practioners of different backgrounds.

For these questions two things were asked. 1) a specific numerical forecast and 2) an interval e.g. x-y that allowed the participant to choose an interval range where they felt 70% confident the correct answer would be. You'll see I graphed the forecasted number, and for the interval range I graphed'd the interval size e.g. 100-500 would be an interval size of 400. The thought of graphing this number was that the larger the number, the wider allowance a range the participant felt confortable forecasting with a 70% confidence.

Question:
How many in the wild zero-day exploits for a Microsoft product will be publicly discovered in Q4 2020 (October, November, December)?Note:(Forecast an exact number e.g. x, where x is a whole number)(Forecast a range e.g. y-z, where you have 70% confidence that the correct answer will fall within your forecasted range not the format of your answer should be two whole numbers signifying a range e.g. y-z)
